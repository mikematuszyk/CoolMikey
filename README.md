🏠 The Homelab

I spend a lot of time tinkering with self-hosted solutions and server setups. My goal is to own my data and learn enterprise networking on a micro scale.

Current focus: Optimizing Docker containers, managing databases, and big data orchestration.

Live Demo: My personal website is running on this infrastructure.

📚 Outside of Tech

When I’m not coding or breaking things in my homelab, you’ll find me:

📖 Reading (Always looking for book recommendations)

🎿 Skiing (Chasing the winter snow)

⛵ Sailing (Enjoying the open water)

Thanks for stopping by!
